# unity_view

Flutter plugin to expose native UnityPlayer views to as a Flutter widget

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter
[plug-in package](https://flutter.io/developing-packages/),
a specialized package that includes platform-specific implementation code for
Android and/or iOS.

For help getting started with Flutter, view our
[online documentation](https://flutter.io/docs), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.


Initially this will be android only. It will include helper methods for sending data between unity and flutter using MethodChannels.
I intend to include full instructions on how to set this up from both the unity any flutter end, including additional instructions for Vuforia AR projects.

The first iteration will require some setup in the native android portion of the target flutter app, however I intend to find a useful way around that.
